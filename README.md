# ZK-Verified NFT (ZK-VNFT)

## Overview
ZK-Verified NFT (ZK-VNFT) is an innovative decentralized platform designed to revolutionize the NFT space by integrating **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** for enhanced privacy and security. Built on the **Ethereum blockchain**, this project enables the creation and ownership of unique NFTs exclusively for verified users, ensuring authenticity without exposing sensitive personal details.

## Features
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Verification:** Users prove eligibility without revealing personal details.
- **Privacy-Focused:** Secure authentication mechanism while keeping user data confidential.
- **Non-Transferable NFTs:** Ensuring exclusivity and trust in digital ownership.
- **Ethereum-Based Smart Contract:** Lightweight and efficient contract ensuring smooth execution.
- **Scalability:** Designed for adoption across communities, organizations, and platforms.
- **Decentralized and Secure:** Eliminates reliance on centralized verification authorities.

## How It Works
1. **User Verification:** Users validate their eligibility using a ZKP-based process.
2. **NFT Minting:** Once verified, users can mint a **single, non-transferable NFT** tied to their address.
3. **Exclusive Access:** Only verified users can obtain and hold these NFTs, ensuring authenticity.

## Smart Contract Deployment
- **Deployed Address (Edu Chain):** `0x78eC469a36A2fD2d4833211aBe023615439dA92F`
- The contract is intentionally simple, requiring no complex inputs or external dependencies.
